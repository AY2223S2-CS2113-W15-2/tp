### Parser

The `Parser` class is a fundamental component instantiated as soon as PocketPal is initialised. Its __purpose__ is to
convert the user's input into structured data which then produces clear instructions for the rest of the program.

Some of its core features include:

- Breaking down user input and extracting the relevant data for further processing.
- Performing input validation and error handling to ensure that input data is in the correct format and ready to be
  processed.
- Converting the input data into the correct format and returning it as a `Command` class to be further processed by the
  application.

Here's a class diagram that shows the core structure of the `Parser` class.

![ParserClassDiagram](../../ParserClassDiagram.png)

How `Parser` works:

1. When a user enters a command, the `Frontend` uses `Parser` to resolve the user input via `parseUserInput()`.
2. Within `parseUserInput()`, the corresponding `parseXCommand()` (`X` is a placeholder for the various command
   names[^1] e.g. `parseAddCommand()`, `parseDeleteCommand()`.)  is invoked to validate that the user input is in the
   correct format. Any exceptions will be thrown and their corresponding error messages will be shown to the user via
   the `ui` class.
2. If the user input is valid, an `XCommand` object containing the relevant data is created and returned.
   E.g. `parseAddCommand()` would create a `AddCommand` object containing the description, price and category.
3. From there, the `XCommand` is ready to be executed by the program. (All `XCommand` classes inherit from `Command` and
   have corresponding `execute()` that carry out their specific instructions.)

[^1]: A list of currently supported commands in PocketPal can be found [here](../../UserGuide.html/features/)

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Parser` component when a user inputs the following
command: `/add McDonalds -c Food -p 10.50`

![ParserSequenceDiagram](../../ParserSequenceDiagram.png)

## Add Command
The add entry mechanism is facilitated by `EntryLog`. Every instance of AddCommand is created with an Entry instance.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add command work:
![AddCommandSequenceDiagram](./static/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `EntryLog` will be initialized and contains no entry.

Step 2. The user executes `/add Lunch at McDonalds -category Food -price 19.9` command to add an `Entry` to the `EntryLog`.

_***Note.*** The command will fail its execution if its format is incorrect, and no `Entry` will be added to the `Entrylog`. An error message will be displayed informing the user._

Step 3. The command will be resolved by `Parser`, which would create an `AddCommmand` object.

Step 4. The `AddCommand` constructor creates and returns an `Entry` object containing the description, price and category to be added.

Step 5. When `execute()` method is called, a `Request` object is created.

Step 6. From there, the `Request` is ready to be handled, which will add the new `Entry` to the `EntryLog`.

Step7. A success message is after the new `Entry`

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add command:

## Delete Command
The delete entry mechanism is facilitated by `EntryLog`.

Every instance of DeleteCommand is created with an Entry instance.

## Glossary

* *glossary item* - Definition

## Instructions for manual testing

## Testing with sample data (from file)

PocketPal stores data in a *storage.txt* file under the "*data/*" directory. Each row in the "*storage.txt*" file
represents a single expense Entry. Each column in each row should have 3 columns, representing the *description* of the
Entry, *amount* associated with the Entry and *category* of the Entry in that order, and are separated with the ","
delimiter. All of them are in the String format.

An example *storage.txt* file that will be readable by PocketPal is as such:

'''
Apple Juice,5.50,Food
Bus Card,50,Transportation
Paracetamol,10.39,Medical
'''

which will give us 3 Entries.

As of the time of writing, the available categories are:

- Clothing
- Entertainment
- Food
- Medical
- Others
- Personal
- Transportation
- Utilities
- Income

An empty input for category is not allowed. If necessary, use the "Others" category.

## Exceptions

Exceptions are thrown for a couple of cases where files are being read. If you wish to test the exceptions, they can be
replicated as follows:

1. Delimiter is invalid: If the delimiter is not the comma (","), it is not recognised as a delimiter and will not be
   processed correctly.
   Example row: Apple Juice|5.50|Food - In this case, the pipe ("|") is used as a delimiter, which is not allowed.
2. Amount is invalid: If the amount is not a numeric, it is not recognised as a valid amount and will not be processed
   correctly.
   Example row: Apple Juice,5A6B,Food - In this case, the amount is "5A6B", which is not a numeric and therefore not
   allowed.
3. Category is invalid: If the category is not a string from the list of allowed categories (see above), it is not
   recognised as a valid category and will not be processed correctly.
   Example row: Apple Juice,5.50,Drink - In this case, the category is "Drink", which is not a valid category and
   therefore not allowed.
4. Not enough columns: If a row has insufficient columns compared to what is needed, the Entry cannot be created.
   Example row: Apple Juice,5.50 - In this case, there are only two categories which is not allowed.

# Launching of PocketPal

First, place the downloaded *PocketPal.jar* into an empty folder. Launch Windows Powershell in the
directory of *PocketPal.jar* and run the following command to launch PocketPal.
