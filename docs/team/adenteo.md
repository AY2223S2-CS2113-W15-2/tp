# PocketPal

PocketPal is a user-friendly money-management app that makes it easy to track expenses. With a command-line interface, users can quickly log and access their expenses, and categorize them by type. Users can also easily filter expenses based on date, category and price range. Overall, PocketPal is a convenient tool for managing your expenses.

Given below are my contributions to the project. 

- __Parser__: The fundamental logic for parsing of user inputs.
    - **What it does**: Accurately and efficiently process user commands and carry out the requested actions.
    - **Justification**: This logic is crucial for interpreting user inputs and allowing the application to seamlessly handle a wide range of commands, hence providing a smooth user experience.
    - **Highlights**: This logic had to be constantly refined as we introduced additional features into PocketPal, and also when bugs were gradually being discovered. It was also challenging to provide a smooth experience where users were able to provide minimal flags but yet achieve a wide range of functionality.
